## Description

This is the Weather Sweater API, an API-only Rails back-end application designed to serve data to a fictional "Sweater Weather" front-end application. It was developed by [Matt Simon](https://github.com/msimon42) as a project for <a href="http://turing.io">Turing School of Software & Design</a> in order to practice 3rd party API consumption, combining outputs, and exposing data and authentication functionality via an API.

## Technologies & Architecture

- Framework: Ruby on Rails
- Testing: RSpec
- Deployment: Heroku
- CI/CD: TravisCI
- JSON Serializer: FastJsonAPI
- 3rd Party APIs:
  - Google Direction Matrix API
  - Google Geocoding API
  - Yelp API
  - Unsplash API
  - DarkSky API
- Response Caching: VCR & Webmock
- Linting: Rubocop
- Test Coverage: SimpleCov

## Test Coverage & Metrics

At time of project submission, Whether Sweater has 100% test coverage, zero Rubocop violations, and all tests passing.

The [project requirements](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/sweater_weather/requirements), [description](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/sweater_weather/), and [rubric](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/sweater_weather/rubric) are available on Turing's [back-end curriculum website](https://backend.turing.io/).
